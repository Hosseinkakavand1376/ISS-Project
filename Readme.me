# Autoencoder Notebook Summary

## Introduction
This notebook contains code to create, train, and evaluate an autoencoder model using Keras. An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient codings of unlabeled data.

## Code Breakdown
1. **Importing Libraries**: The necessary libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras are imported.
2. **Data Preparation**: The dataset is loaded and preprocessed. The data is expanded to fit the input shape required by the autoencoder.
3. **Model Architecture**: The autoencoder architecture is defined, consisting of an encoder and a decoder.
4. **Model Compilation**: The model is compiled with a loss function and an optimizer.
5. **Model Training**: The autoencoder is trained on the training dataset.
6. **Model Evaluation**: The autoencoder is evaluated on the test dataset to determine its reconstruction loss.
7. **Reconstruction**: The trained autoencoder is used to reconstruct the test dataset.

## Conclusion
The notebook demonstrates the entire process of building an autoencoder, from data preparation to model evaluation.
